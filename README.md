# Week1Challenge
Refactor and accessibility challenge
## Description

I wanted to reinforce my learning of basic HTML and CSS. I wanted to be able to refactor the code, by tidying it up. I had noticed lots of repetition in the CSS code, lots of use of <div> in the html code and that one of the links on the page did not work. I wanted to work out how to correct these.
I wanted to learn and reinforce some good habits of commenting out, and frequent commits.
I wanted to practise the process of pushing work to github.
I wanted to leave the code neater than how I found it.
I wanted to deploy my finished product and check it had no errors.
I wanted to practise writing an appropriate README.md.
I wanted to ensure the website had improved accessibility.
